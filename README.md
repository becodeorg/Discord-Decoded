# Discord Decoded

Discord is an online communication tool similar to programs such as Skype or TeamSpeak, or professional communications platforms like Slack. It supports video calls, voice chat, and text, allowing users to get in touch however they please. In this manual I'll try to cover everything you possibly need in order to use it. If you have any questions after checking out the manual and the FAQ feel free to send me a mail on the address tim.broos@becode.org with the subject "Discord Decoded".
